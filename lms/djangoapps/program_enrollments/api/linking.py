        Utility function to link ProgramEnrollments to LMS Users

        Arguments:
            -program_uuid: the program for which we are linking program enrollments
            -external_keys_to_usernames: dict mapping `external_user_keys` to LMS usernames.

        Returns:

            }

        Raises: ValueError if None is included in external_keys_to_usernames

        This function will look up program enrollments and users, and update the program
        enrollments with the matching user. If the program enrollment has course enrollments, we
        will enroll the user into their waiting program courses.

        For each external_user_key:lms_username, if:
            - The user is not found
            - No enrollment is found for the given program and external_user_key
            - The enrollment already has a user
        An error message will be logged, and added to a dictionary of error messages keyed by
        (external_key, username). The input will be skipped. All other inputs will be processed and
        enrollments updated, and then the function will return the dictionary of error messages.

        If there is an error while enrolling a user in a waiting program course enrollment, the
        error will be logged, and added to the returned error dictionary, and we will roll back all
        transactions for that user so that their db state will be the same as it was before this
        function was called, to prevent program enrollments to be in a state where they have an LMS
        user but still have waiting course enrollments. All other inputs will be processed
        normally.
